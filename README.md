# Academic Guidelines and Tips
## Mental Health
You can do good research if you first do self-care mentally and physically. There are a lot of suggestions out there, but some of the interesting ones for me are listed below:

  > It is actually fairly simple. There are three orthogonal criteria. You ask the following questions: First, was it hard? When you look at the research, does this require years of training and perspiration, or could anyone on the street have come up with it? Second, is it elegant? Is this something that solves a specific problem, or is this something that you can apply over and over again to new problems? Third, is it useful? Is it valuable only to the academic community, or can people outside the academic community use it to create value or make money? ... 
  > The only important thing is to push the boundaries as far as you can. Face the hardest problems. Find the most elegant abstraction. Make it really useful. Push, push, push, with all love and respect. That's what makes good research.
